# How it works in action!

**Player loads the start screen and repeatedly taps the screen to move the astronaut**

- The more rockets the player collects, the more points he/she will have
- As the player collects more rockets, the speed of the astronaut and the value of each rocket will increase

**Once the player hits a spike ball, the game is over**
